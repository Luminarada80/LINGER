# Copy of LINGER

This repository is my personal copy of [LINGER](https://github.com/Durenlab/LINGER/) from the Duren lab. 
Please refer to that link for tutorials and for the original source code. This repo is designed to run our Pipeline and to
store a cleaned-up version of the source code with more documentation and in-line comments.
